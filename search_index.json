your consumer's project. That's not always what you want. From a github issue on NuGet, I learned a neat trick to hide all the files in your package, automatically! All you need is to include a .props file in your package build folder (i.e. if your package is named Foo, make sure the file ends up build\\Foo.props)\n\n\n  \n    \n      false\n    \n  \n\n\n\nThis works because NuGet generates a .props file containing all your contentFiles items, under the obj folder, which contains both pieces of metadata used above to filter the visibility on items coming from our package. \n"},"dotnet/nuget/packaging-transitive-analyzers-with-nuget.html":{"url":"dotnet/nuget/packaging-transitive-analyzers-with-nuget.html","title":"Packaging transitive analyzers with NuGet","keywords":"","body":"Packaging transitive analyzers with NuGet\nConsider the scenario of ThisAssembly and its referenced packages: the main package is essentially a meta-package so that anyone wanting to leverage all the codegen in all the ThisAssembly.* packages can reference a single one.

Not good since now it means projects referencing this package will not get the transitive analyzers, which are precisely the point of this meta-package. \nThe fix is highly non-obvious: you must explicitly state that none of the referenced project assets are to be flagged as private:\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n\nThis properly allows the transitive build and analyzer assets to be properly installed on the referencing project.\n"},"dotnet/nuget/use-dotnet-vs-to-get-developer-prompt-in-terminal.html":{"url":"dotnet/nuget/use-dotnet-vs-to-get-developer-prompt-in-terminal.html","title":"How to add search to static nuget feed","keywords":"","body":"How to add search to static nuget feed\nI have been using static serverless nuget feeds for a while now. Sleet is totally awesome. One missing piece was search: searching a static feed would just return everything, always. Not anymore!\nTo set it up:\n\nFork Sleet.Search: this is the Azure function project that will perform the search on your static feeds. You'll host your own in a consumption (aka serverless) plan in Azure.\nCreate an Azure Functions app and follow the deployment steps from my blog: that's basically setting up the simplest CI/CD for a GH repo.\nBy default, the project allows passing in the static feed \"search\" url (which is a blob named under /search/query in your sleet blob container) and requires function authentication. In my case, I wanted a simpler search URL and anonymous access, so I made that change to Sleet.Search. Basically the function can now be accessed at /query, without URL-encoding another URL parameter there.\nFollow instructions to enable search for your sleet feed via settings. \n\nThat's it. Now you can configure my feed https://pkg.kzu.io/index.json and it will be fully searchable. Plus, I used Azure Functions Proxies to make the blob storage URL that much nicer. I even made the query URL nice, since it was trivial too: https://pkg.kzu.io/search 😍.\n"},"dotnet/nuget/populate-repositorybranch-in-ci-for-nuget-pack.html":{"url":"dotnet/nuget/populate-repositorybranch-in-ci-for-nuget-pack.html","title":"Populate RepositoryBranch in CI for NuGet Pack","keywords":"","body":"Populate RepositoryBranch in CI for NuGet Pack\nI learned that RepositoryBranch is the only NuGet Pack-related property not populated already by the .NET SDK+SourceLink. So instead of going for a full-blown (and typically over-blown) solution for build/assembly versioning from Git information (such as GitInfo or GitVersion or the myriad others), you can trivially pass in this value from your CI script with:\n dotnet pack -p:RepositoryBranch=${GITHUB_REF#refs/*/}\n\nThis works in all OSes if you're running with a bash shell. On a Windows agent, you'd need to opt-in to that using shell: bash on the run action (if you're using GitHub Actions). Or you can also just default to bash for all run actions.\nNOTE: the wildcard instead of heads is so that this also works for tags, in which case the \"branch\" will be the tag name.\n"},"dotnet/quickly-check-c-compiler-and-language-version.html":{"url":"dotnet/quickly-check-c-compiler-and-language-version.html","title":"Quickly check C# compiler and language version","keywords":"","body":"Quickly check C# compiler and language version\nJust add #error version anywhere in a C# file and you'll see a tooltip with the information:\n\n"},"dotnet/disable-diagnostic-analyzers-for-entire-folder-submodules.html":{"url":"dotnet/disable-diagnostic-analyzers-for-entire-folder-submodules.html","title":"Disable diagnostic analyzers for entire folder/submodules","keywords":"","body":"Disable diagnostic analyzers for entire folder/submodules\nWhen you have submodules in your repository, it's not uncommon for those to be subject to a different quality bar than your main project.

For example, this is one I use to set up https://pkg.kzu.io/index.json > https://kzu.blob.core.windows.net/nuget/index.json:\n{\n    \"$schema\": \"http://json.schemastore.org/proxies\",\n    \"proxies\": {\n        \"default\": {\n            \"matchCondition\": {\n                \"methods\": [ \"GET\" ],\n                \"route\": \"index.json\"\n            },\n            \"responseOverrides\": {\n                \"response.statusCode\": \"307\",\n                \"response.headers.location\": \"https://kzu.blob.core.windows.net/nuget/index.json\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n"},"devops-ci-cd/how-to-skip-steps-or-jobs-in-github-actions-for-prs-from-forks.html":{"url":"devops-ci-cd/how-to-skip-steps-or-jobs-in-github-actions-for-prs-from-forks.html","title":"How to skip steps or jobs in GitHub Actions for PRs from forks","keywords":"","body":"How to skip steps or jobs in GitHub Actions for PRs from forks\nEncrypted secrets in GitHub actions aren't available for builds from forks, so if your build script includes PRs, like Avatar:\non: \n  push:\n    branches: [ main, dev, 'feature/*', 'rel/*' ]\n  pull_request:\n    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]\n\nYou may need to limit steps or entire jobs from running when PRs are coming from forks due to missing secrets (i.e. pushing an output package to a CI nuget feed, say).\nThe \"magic\" thing is to use an if condition with the following expression:\n  push:\n    name: push nuget.ci\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    needs: [build, acceptance]\n    if: ${{ !github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork }}\n    steps:\n\nNote that in the above case, an entire job is skipped, but you can also apply it to a step instead.\n"},"devops-ci-cd/update-version-and-publish-npm-from-gh.html":{"url":"devops-ci-cd/update-version-and-publish-npm-from-gh.html","title":"Update version and publish npm from GH","summary":"Setting up CI with GitHub Actions to update a node.js package version from GitHub release tag and publish it to npm","keywords":"","body":"Update version and publish npm from GH\nSuper proud of this, since it's my first node.js package ever (created brand-new account on https://www.npmjs.com/ and all 😁), for doing syntax highlighting for dotnetconfig that works in docfx. \nAssuming you already have a package.json in the root repo dir, add the .github\\workflows\\npm.yml as follows:\nname: publish\n\non:\n  release:\n    types: [created]\n\njobs:\n  publish-npm:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v2\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1\n        with:\n          node-version: 12\n          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/\n      - name: Set version from tag\n        run: npm --no-git-tag-version version ${GITHUB_REF#refs/*/}\n      - run: npm publish\n        env:\n          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.npm_token}}\n\n\nI'm running only on release creation\nUsing the GitHub envvar for the checked out tag, I'm updating the version but opting out of the git behavior (which fails on CI because it's a detached head at that point)\nFinally you'll need to create that secret in GH for the publish step.\n\n"},"devops-ci-cd/push-to-protected-branch-from-github-actions.html":{"url":"devops-ci-cd/push-to-protected-branch-from-github-actions.html","title":"Push to protected branch from GitHub actions","keywords":"","body":"Push to protected branch from GitHub actions\nIt turns out that you really can't just git push from your GitHub actions if the repository has branch protection turned on or required checks before merging. Sorta makes sense, but still a PITA.\nThe solution that worked for me was to use a different token on checkout.
